### Brief introduction
<p align="justify">
If you are a fan of the movie Shoot 'Em Up produced in 2007, then you
already know where the name of my game comes from. However,
although I really wanted to create a story-based game from this movie, I
felt that I was still not qualified and capable, so the similarity between my
game and that movie was just the name. Even though, I also know that
shoot 'em up is also the name of a subgenre of video games within the
subgenre shooter in the genre action. <br/> <br/>
A "shoot 'em up", also known as "STG" (the common Japanese
abbreviation for "shooting games"), is a game in which protagonist
combats a large number of enemies by shooting at while dodging their
fire. The controlling player must rely on enroll on reaction times to
succeed. <br/> <br/>
One of the classic games of this genre is Contra - a legendary game for
the kids who was born in the 90's decade. I am also a huge fan of Contra,
and those childhood memories inspired me on the idea of creating a game
of this genre. Shoot 'Em Up is a 3D game where you will have to destroythe enemies by shooting and destroying them, and must dodge the bullets 
from the target to make sure that you won’t die before them. Finally, at
the end of the level, there will be a boss that you have to destroy, similar
to the old four-button games like Mario or Contra. <br/> <br/>
Although I tried to research and focus on working, but I alone was not
able to create a game that was really over-the-top. And of course there are
still a lot of bugs in my game, but due to the limitation of my time and
ability, I hope you will understand.

Developing games is a completely new field for me, besides, I am also
working on graduation thesis and part-time for a company so my schedule
is quite busy. So in addition to learning the knowledge in class, I also
bought 2 online courses at Udemy to get more knowledge and searched
for more reference sources on the internet.
